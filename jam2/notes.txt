Check the selected taxonomy, and see if the user has any nodes in it. If not, they aren't allowed to submit, and must enter something different.
Add a form_alter to reduce the available album/artist selections to those created by the user.
These are both reasonable heavyweight operations, so caching should be used as much as possible. Perhaps every time we create a new term, we populate a table of user=>term mappings?

Instead of the above, we currently allow anyone to create a album, but only that person can modify the album.
Once an album has been created, no further albums can use that taxonomy
