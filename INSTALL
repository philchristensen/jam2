Jam2 QuickStart Guide


Installing this module is like installing any other, just drop the jam2 folder into your modules directory
in your Drupal installation.

You'll also need to have the HTTP::Request PEAR module installed, if you don't already. This allows Jam2 to
determine file size and other essential information about jams referenced via URL.

Once you've activated the module on the admin/modules page, you should find four new node types available under
the node/add page. These include:

    * jam - Okay, it could have just been called 'song', or 'audio', or 'media', but that wouldn't have been nearly
        as hip. These node types allow you to upload a single mp3, flv, or other media file. If you wish to use
        the built-in flash media players, you'll need to use mp3 or flv. If you want to podcast the jam, you're
        a little more limited, but we'll get into that later.
    
    * album - Once you've created at least one jam, and defined an album for it, you can create one of these
        nodes to assign artwork and other metadata to the album. I find this node type ideal for front-page content.
    
    * podcast - Creating one of these nodes will configure the general paramters of a podcast. This isn't where
        you upload content, that's an episode. Podcast types let you manage the iTunes title, category, summary,
        and other podcast-specific metadata.
    
    * episode - Once you've created a podcast, you can add episodes to it by creating nodes of this type.
