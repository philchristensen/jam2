Jam2
a drupal module
for Drupal 4.7

(c) Phil Christensen

Jam2 is a collection of components for the Drupal CMS platform.

Jam2 provides a number on new node types that allow independent musicians to upload media and cover art,
add album and artist data, and create and manage podcasts of new material or previously uploaded jams.
Uploaded media can be presented to the user as an embedded Flash player, a download link, or both.

Users can create podcasts that feature the full array of iTunes tag data, so that podcasts can be easily
listed with the iTunes Podcast Directory. Albums, once defined, can also provide their own podcasts,
allowing musicians who choose so to involve their fans throughout the creation of an album.
